# 🔓 VERCEL DEPLOYMENT PROTECTION - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Current Status
Your Vercel deployment has **"Vercel Authentication"** enabled, which requires visitors to log in to Vercel to access your app.

## 📋 HOW TO DISABLE PROTECTION

### **Option 1: Disable Vercel Authentication (Recommended)**

1. **In your Vercel Dashboard**, go to your project: `bigquery-ai`
2. **Click on "Settings"** tab
3. **Scroll down to "Deployment Protection"** section
4. **Find "Vercel Authentication"**
5. **Click the toggle to turn it OFF**
6. **Click "Save"** at the bottom
7. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for auto-redeploy

### **Option 2: Use Protection Bypass Secret**

1. **In Deployment Protection section**
2. **Scroll to "Protection Bypass for Automation"**
3. **Click "Add a secret"**
4. **Create a bypass secret** (Vercel will generate one)
5. **Copy the secret value**
6. **Use it in URLs like:**
   ```
   https://bigquery-ai-git-master-datamans-projects.vercel.app/api/test/dashboard?x-vercel-protection-bypass=YOUR_SECRET_HERE
   ```

### **Option 3: Create Shareable Link**

1. **Go to your deployment page**
2. **Click the "Share" button**
3. **Create a shareable link**
4. **Use that link** (bypasses all protection)
