## 🚨 Problem Statement

### The Multimodal Data Challenge
Modern retailers face an unprecedented data complexity challenge:

1. **Data Volume Explosion**: Petabytes of customer reviews, product images, sales data, and social media mentions
2. **Modal Diversity**: Text reviews, visual product images, structured sales data, and unstructured social data
3. **Analysis Fragmentation**: Traditional tools handle only single data modalities, requiring manual integration
4. **Real-time Requirements**: Business decisions need instant insights, not weekly reports
5. **Semantic Gap**: Current systems miss contextual relationships between different data types

### Business Impact of the Problem
- **Lost Revenue**: Inability to identify cross-selling opportunities across data modalities
- **Operational Inefficiency**: Manual analysis of product quality and customer sentiment
- **Delayed Decisions**: Lack of real-time insights for pricing and inventory optimization
- **Customer Dissatisfaction**: Failure to provide personalized recommendations based on complete customer profiles

### Why BigQuery AI is the Perfect Solution
BigQuery's native AI capabilities provide a unified platform where multimodal data can be processed, analyzed, and acted upon without data movement or tool switching.

    CONCAT('Generate executive summary for retail performance: ',
           'Revenue: $', total_revenue,
           ', Growth: ', growth_rate, '%',
           ', Top category: ', top_category)
  ) as executive_summary,
  AI.GENERATE_TABLE('gemini-1.5-flash',
    'Create optimization roadmap with columns: priority, action, impact, timeline',
    STRUCT(category_performance, market_trends AS context)
  ) as optimization_roadmap
FROM `retail_analytics.daily_performance`;
```

#### Approach 2: Semantic Detective (Vector Search)
```sql
-- Intelligent Product Recommendations
CREATE VECTOR INDEX `product_similarity_index`
ON `retail_analytics.product_embeddings`(text_embedding)
OPTIONS(index_type='IVF', distance_type='COSINE');

SELECT
  target.product_name as input_product,
  similar.product_name as recommended_product,
  distance as similarity_score
FROM VECTOR_SEARCH(
  TABLE `retail_analytics.product_embeddings`,
